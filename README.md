##  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/).

#   RULES
1.  Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
2.  Fulfill the below user stories: 
    - Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
    - I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
    - I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
